# Harry Potter :- Useless Saga üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Individual]


### Team Members
- Alka Devi

### Project Description
This project is a fun, dramatic Harry Potter-themed "Losers' Graveyard" webpage that humorously memorializes fallen champions with eerie visuals, spooky animation, haunting background music, and themed effects. It combines dark aesthetics, rotating tombstone imagery, and a gothic font to create an immersive experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
This project solves the age-old problem of where to eternally mock failed champions. With blood-red text, spooky music, and a haunted vibe, it finally gives them the over-the-top memorial they never asked for.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
By throwing logic out the window and embracing melodrama, we built an overly theatrical graveyard powered by HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of chaos. With haunting music, glowing buttons, and flickering regret, users can finally mourn (or mock) their fictional failures in style.
